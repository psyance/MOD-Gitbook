# Minting Godz

The Mint of Destiny is the brain child of 2 guys with God Mode powers in Blockchain game development. They have developed many NFT-based games before this one and have worked with some large blockchain game developers. Most notably, they have created side-games for [Wizards and Dragons](https://wnd.game) and [Space NFT Game](https://spacenft.game).

### adoom

Having worked over 20 years in IT security working for some of the largest financial institutions in the world, federal agencies, and private corporations, he has built out enterprise-level architectures and deployments that are heavily relied upon. He has been working in crypto for the past 4 years, and been actively developing Solidity smart contracts, web3 front end integrations, and coming up with groundbreaking NFT utility for his clients and [NFTArcade](https://nftarca.de).

adoom is part of the [Krypto Sucks!](https://kryptosucks.com) team that has his face out there for the world to see via their podcasts, he doesn't cower behind the anona-dev personas that the sketch NFT world lives in.

### wilb

Arguably one of the best developers in the Etherverse, wilb has been working in enterprise development projects for most of the past decade. Well-versed in every major language out there, wilb take the title of "The Smart One" in the group. Having run massive mining operations, and edge-pushing AI for crypto bot-trading software, wilb has a hardline to the blockchain.

wilb is the other half of the Krypto Sucks! team with his face out for everyone to envy his majestic beard with as well. No anona-devs here!
