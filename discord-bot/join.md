description: Bot command in Discord to Join the Mint of Destiny game
---

# ðŸ¤– /join

Use this command to [join the game](../gameplay/getting-started-101.md) from within the NFTArcade Discord. You need to do this first before you can do anything else in the game.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT ðŸ‘‰**</mark> **You must have at least a balance of 0.1 ETH in your wallet** that you are verifying to play with. This is to prevent spammers from ruining the game. No ETH will every be needed to be spent to play. Just to verify to be able to play.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
All commands must be issued in the <mark style="color:purple;">**#general**</mark> channel
{% endhint %}

When you issue the <mark style="color:purple;">**/join**</mark> command in the #general channel in Discord, you will be presented with a link to "Verify Now!" which will open up your browser to verify with your wallet.

You will then see a confirmation dialog pop up to make sure you know you're leaving Discord. Go ahead and click "Yep!"

Your browser will then open up the website https://api.nftarca.de/verify with a unique token ID at the end. Here you will need to have your Ethereum wallet setup to sign a message (MetaMask / Coinbase Wallet / etc). If your wallet doesn't open automatically, you can click the Big Red Button and it'll open up your wallet to connect to the site sign a message.

In your wallet, you will need to connect and then push the Big Red Button to open the wallet to sign a message to verify ownership of the wallet address. It will also verify that you have a minimum balance of at least 0.1 ETH. This is to prevent spammers from joining the game.

Once you have verified ownership, you will be presented with a confirmation dialog that you have the Verified role and you can close the browser and return the Discord to begin playing The Mint of Destiny!

![If you see this, you're good to go!](<../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png>)

Back in Discord, you'll now see that your name is green and if you click on it to see your roles, you will now have the Verified role.

Once you have joined, you can run the <mark style="color:purple;">**/stats**</mark> command to see your stats as a player. When you first start out, it'll look something like this:
