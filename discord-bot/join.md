description: Bot command in Discord to Join the Mint of Destiny game
---

# ðŸ¤– /join

Use this command to [join the game](../gameplay/getting-started-101.md) from within the NFTArcade Discord. You need to do this first before you can do anything else in the game.

{% hint style="info" %}
All commands must be issued in the <mark style="color:purple;">**#general**</mark> channel
{% endhint %}

When you issue the <mark style="color:purple;">**/join**</mark> command in the #general channel in Discord, you will be presented with a link to "Verify Now!" which will open up your browser to verify with your wallet.

You will then see a confirmation dialog pop up to make sure you know you're leaving Discord. Go ahead and click "Yep!"

Your browser will then open up the website https://api.nftarca.de/verify with a unique token ID at the end. Here you will need to have your Ethereum wallet setup to sign a message (MetaMask / Coinbase Wallet / etc). If your wallet doesn't open automatically, you can click the Big Red Button and it'll open up your wallet to connect to the site sign a message.

In your wallet, you will need to connect and then push the Big Red Button to open the wallet to sign a message to verify ownership of the wallet address. It will also verify that you have a minimum balance of at least 0.1 ETH. This is to prevent spammers from joining the game.
