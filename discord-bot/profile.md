# ðŸ¤– /profile

You can issue the /profile command by passing in the Token ID of the Hero Role NFT you own to set it as your profile photo. This will then be displayed as you play the game and throughout the website as your avatar.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">**/profile \[Token ID]**</mark>
{% endhint %}

**Example:**

<mark style="color:purple;">/profile 8435</mark>
