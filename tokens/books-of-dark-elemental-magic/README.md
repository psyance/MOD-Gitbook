### What are Books of Dark Elemental Magic?

Throughout the Etherverse, there are books containing Dark Magic that can be used by Warlocks to summon creatures from other dimensions and open portals to other worlds and time. While any hero can acquire one of these books, only Warlock have the power to unlock them and user their powers.

### How Do We Find the Books?

Any Hero can discover the books while Exploring the Etherverse. It will be important for them to have enough Rupeez to trade with to be able to acquire them though.

There are four types of Dark Elemental Magic:

### How To Unlock a Book

Every book has been uniquely bound and locked with a key by the Minting Gods. The key to unlocking these books are tied to specific time of their creation. Once a Warlock has discovered the key and unlocked the book, they can use the book to cast spells. Every type of book has different spells that can be cast based on the level of spells discovered.
