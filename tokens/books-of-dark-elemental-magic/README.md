### What are Books of Dark Elemental Magic?

Throughout the Etherverse, there are books containing Dark Magic that can be used by [Warlocks](../villains/warlocks/) to summon creatures from other dimensions and open portals to other worlds and time. While any hero can acquire one of these books while [Exploring](../../gameplay/earning-points/exploring.md), only Warlock have the power to unlock them and user their powers.

### How Do We Find the Books?

Any Hero can discover the books while [Exploring](../../gameplay/earning-points/exploring.md) the Etherverse. It will be important for them to have enough Rupeez to trade with to be able to acquire them though.

There are four types of Dark Elemental Magic:

### How To Unlock a Closed Book

Every book has been uniquely bound and locked with a key by the Minting Gods. The key to unlocking these books are tied to specific time of their creation. Once a Warlock has discovered the key and unlocked the book, they can use the book to cast spells. Every type of book has different spells that can be cast based on the level of spells discovered.

### How To Unlock Chapter 2

If you have unlocked your books with the key, you're well on your way to mastering the Dark Arts of Elemental Magic! Chapter 1 allows players to cast random spells, but not very effectively. Players will have to practice casting spells to really get the hang of it. Once they have successfully proven they can control their magic, the books will whisper to them the first clue in how to unlock Chapter 2.
