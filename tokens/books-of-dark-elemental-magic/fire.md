![Air Book #17133](../../.gitbook/assets/17133.png)

The Dark Elemental Book of Fire is the most rare of the elements. Fire, embers, ash, and smoke become as easy to manipulate as a sword or your own voice. Catastrophic damage is at your fingertips.

## Spells

Various spells can be [/cast](../../discord-bot/cast.md) by players that have [Warlock](../villains/warlocks/). Various spells are available for each chapter that they have opened.

## Locked Book

Players cannot cast spells with a locked book. They will first have to [/unlock](../../discord-bot/unlock.md) it.
