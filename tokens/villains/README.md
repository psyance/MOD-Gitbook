# Villains

### What Are Villains?

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT**</mark>: You can only earn 1 Villain NFT per wallet / discord name from fighting. Once you fight a Minion and win a n00b NFT, you can no longer win additional n00b or Minion NFTs. So if you sell it, the only want to get it back is to buy it back on a secondary market.
{% endhint %}

There are three types of Villains within The Mint of Destiny Etherverse:

* <mark style="color:purple;">**Minions**</mark> - More annoying than scary
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Mini-Bosses**</mark> - Challenging but drunk most of the time
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Bosses**</mark> - They take their job seriously, and get joy from slaying Heroes
