### What Are Villains?

At the beginning of time, wait... no. _BEFORE_ the beginning of time, the Mint of Destiny was forged by the [Minting Godz](../../about/minting-godz.md) in fires of a birthing star (yes... time hasn't started yet.

* <mark style="color:purple;">**Bosses**</mark> - They take their job seriously, and get joy from slaying Heroes
