# Minion

These little annoyances are scattered throughout the Etherverse to be offered up more as a sacrificial pawn to those looking to cut their teeth in the game. There are a variety of unique minions with different traits and levels to spice things up a bit.

### How To Defeat a Minion

First, you must have already joined the game in Discord ([/join](../../discord-bot/join.md)). After you have joined into the game, you will now begin to earn points. Once you have earned enough points, you can attempt to [fight](../../gameplay/fighting.md) a [Minion](minion.md). If you are successful in defeating the [Minion](minion.md), you will be granted the n00b role, a n00b Hero NFT, and the NFT of the [Minion](minion.md) that you have defeated. There are only 5,000 Minions that can be minted.&#x20;

To fight a minion, issue the following command in discord once you have at least 100 points:

```
/fight minion
```
