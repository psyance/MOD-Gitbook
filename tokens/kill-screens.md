# ðŸ‘¾ Kill Screens

![](../.gitbook/assets/KillScreen1-200.jpg)

Kill Screens are the infamous "_Holy crap, you've gone farther in the game than was ever intended, so now it just breaks the code and dies_" screens from some of the most popular games that created the video game industry as we know it.

We wanted to pay an homage to them and offer up the ability for the most god-like players that want to prove their reign over everyone else in the game.

### How Many Kill Screens Are There?

There are only 20 Kill Screen Tokens that can be won, each with their own [difficulty level](kill-screens.md#kill-screen-difficulty-levels).

### How To Try For a Kill Screen?

You will need a few things first before you even _think_ about attempting a Kill Screen!&#x20;

* [n00b](heroes/n00b.md) NFT
* [Hardcore](heroes/hardcore.md) NFT
* [Legendary](heroes/legendary.md) NFT
* [4,200 Points](../gameplay/earning-points/)

Once you have all of those you can run the following command in Discord to launch the next step in the Kill Screen prep command to verify your supreme gaming abilities (that you meet the requirements to try):

```
/killscreen [n00b Token ID] [Hardcore Token ID] [Legendary Token ID]

eg:
/killscreen 2342 5634 8043
```

You will be presented with the confirmation that you want to proceed with a Kill Screen attempt, and that by doing so, you will be putting those NFTs up for chance. You've laid it all out on the line, and now comes the moment of truth! Depending on which Kill Screen number you are attempting will determine [the difficulty of the attack](kill-screens.md#kill-screen-difficulty-levels). Obviously, you can only enter token IDs of tokens that you own (and yes, we verify on the chain to make sure ðŸ˜ˆ)

If you want to take another shot at a Kill Screen you will have to earn back enough points and purchase the necessary Hero Tokens from the secondary market.
