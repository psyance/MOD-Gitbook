# Heroes

### What Are Heroes?

First off, you are the Hero. The Hero tokens will be your avatar in the game to show your competion how fierce your are and scream "Be afraid of me!" Heroes are the NFTs that you can win from fighting [Villains](../villains/). These NFTs are what grant you your roles within Discord. Special channels have been made where only those with the role can access and gloat to each other how awesome they are. In addition, the developers will give special attention to various roles. This may include alpha on in-game releases, whitelists for future games, or free airdrops!

There are three roles within The Mint of Destiny:

* n00b (not so scary)
* Hardcore (pretty darn scary)
* Legendary (do not make eye contact or you'll burst into flames, scary!)
