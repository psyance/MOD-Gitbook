# Fighting

The only way to level up your Hero in the game is to [/fight](../discord-bot/fight.md) Villains! There are three types of [Villains](../tokens/villains/) that all have various difficulty levels assigned to them. Each [Villain](../tokens/villains/) is uniquely generated and has varying degrees of uniqueness based on the traits associate with it. You will need the minimum necessary points and roles to be able to fight the Villain.

### How to fight

All fights take place within Discord. You will need to issue the following command:

```
/fight [Villain Type]
```

Your options for \[Villain Type] are:

* [Minion](../tokens/villains/minion.md)
* [Mini-Boss](../tokens/villains/mini-boss.md)
* [Boss](../tokens/villains/boss.md)

When you submit this command and have the proper requirements (see individual Villain Token details for these), the [Discord Bot](broken-reference) will return the details of the Villain you have chosen to do battle with. At this time you can see the Villain Type, their Level (chance of winning), a thumbnail of the NFT that will be won, and two options to choose from to continue:

1. Fight - This will enter your Hero into battle with the Villain. Should you win, you will receive the NFT of the Villain you just defeated, and the Hero NFT of the new role you just acquired.
2. Run - Change your mind and don't want to fight? You can run away and only loose half the points of a loss.

### Villain Rank

The rank of a Villain is directly tied to the chance of winning the fight when you attempt it. The level is 1/10th the chance you have to lose. So if a Villain is a Level 4, you will have a 40% chance of losing the fight against them. There is nothing you can do to improve or worsen the odds. Everyone that fights that Villain will have the same 60% chance of winning.

### Rank Categories

| Villain Type                                 | Ranks | Chance of Winning |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| [Minion](../tokens/villains/minion.md)       | 1 - 3 | 90% - 70%         |
| [Mini-Boss](../tokens/villains/mini-boss.md) | 3 - 5 | 70% - 50%         |
| [Boss](../tokens/villains/boss.md)           | 5 - 7 | 50% - 30%         |
