# Fighting

The only way to level up your Hero in the game is to [/fight](../discord-bot/fight.md) Villains! There are three types of [Villains](../tokens/villains/) that all have various difficulty levels assigned to them. Each [Villain](../tokens/villains/) is uniquely generated and has varying degrees of uniqueness based on the traits associate with it.

## Villain Rank

The rank of a Villain is directly tied to the chance of winning the fight when you attempt it. The level is 1/10th the chance you have to lose. So if a Villain is a Level 4, you will have a 40% chance of losing the fight against them. There is nothing you can do to improve or worsen the odds. Everyone that fights that Villain will have the same 60% chance of winning.

### Rank Categories

* n00b : Rank 1-3&#x20;
* Hardcore **:** Rank 3-5 . &#x20;
