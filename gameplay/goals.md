# Goals

There is really only one true goal of this game, and it is to be the ONE that receives the God-like status of the owner of <mark style="color:green;">**THE MINT OF DESTINY!**</mark>

Other goals of the game could be to win some free NFTs, level up your Hero (you) to be the top of our leaderboard, be the first to score a Kill Screen, earn respect from your peers, or just to be part of history in the worlds first Discord NFT game that's free to play!
