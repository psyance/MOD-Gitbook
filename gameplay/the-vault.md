# The Vault

## What's in the Vault?&#x20;

### Short answer

Everything.

### Long answer

Every time a new NFT is made available into the game, whether it's a [Hero](../tokens/heroes/), [Villain](../tokens/villains/), or limited edition [Hero Skin](../tokens/skins/), 1 of them is immediately minted and stored into the Vault. So if there is a limited Legendary skin with only 10 available, 1 is vaulted away for the Mint of Destiny owner, and only 9 are available to the public.

The Vault will continue to grow indefinitely while the game is in play. Even after the Mint of Destiny has been awarded (if someone is actually worthy of such a challenge), all new NFTs will have one of them partitioned off into the Vault for the Mint of Destiny owner to claim whenever they want.&#x20;
