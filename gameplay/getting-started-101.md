# ðŸ§  Getting Started - 101

### Have a Wallet with some ETH

You will need to have a wallet on MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet that has at least 0.1 ETH in it. There is no cost to join the game and play (not even gas!) but we do this to prevent spammers from clogging up the game and stealing all the NFTs =)

If you don't have MetaMask or not sure how to set it up, [we have a guide on how to do all this.](../techy-stuff/installing-and-setting-up-metamask.md)

### Join Our Discord

You can access discord via their website ([https://Discord.com](https://discord.gg/rgPPDMWC)), or from a client on your computer, or even from their mobile app. Create an account with them, verify your email and phone number (don't worry, that stays with Discord), and then head over to our Discord channel and say hi!



{% hint style="info" %}
**Discord Link to Play:** [<mark style="color:purple;">**https://discord.gg/vPAgf7Q772**</mark>](https://discord.gg/vPAgf7Q772)<mark style="color:purple;">****</mark>
{% endhint %}



### Verify Your Wallet via Discord

Now that you're in the NFTArcade Discord, you can join the game super easy. First you want to make sure you're in the <mark style="color:purple;">**#general**</mark> channel and then type the following command where it says "Message #general":

```
/join
```

{% hint style="info" %}
[<mark style="color:purple;">**Click here to view detailed steps on how to /join**</mark>](../discord-bot/join.md)<mark style="color:purple;">****</mark>
{% endhint %}

That will open your browser and take you to the NFTArcade verification page. Here you will click on the Big Green Button. This will open up your wallet (Metamask, etc) to sign a message to verify that you own the wallet address and associate it with your discord name. There are no fees or gas costs to do this and it's totally safe. It's like logging in with your wallet.

Once that is completed, you will be given <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Rupeez-small (8) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">50 Rupeez as a bonus to start with and you can begin your journey. You will then be prompted that you can close the window, and back in Discord you will now be granted the Lurker role. At this point you're in the game! You will now start earning points for your interaction with the game and the community!

### Earn Rupeez, Fight Villains, Gain Status!

From here you play the game as outlined in this whitepaper. You should skip to [Earning Rupeez](earning-points/) to see how you can earn enough Rupeez so that you can [Fight](fighting.md) your first [Minion](../tokens/villains/minion.md) to attempt to win the [n00b](../tokens/heroes/n00b.md) role NFT and Minion NFT!

At any point in the game, you can issue the /help command to list all the commands, or type in "!help" for the quick start guide, which will show this:
