# ðŸ§  Getting Started - 101

### Have a Wallet

You will need to have an Ethereum wallet setup to be able to play. There is no cost to join the game and play (not even gas!) but we do this to prevent spammers from clogging up the game and stealing all the NFTs =)

If you don't have MetaMask or not sure how to set it up, [we have a guide on how to do all this.](../techy-stuff/installing-and-setting-up-metamask.md)

### Join Our Discord

You can access discord via their website ([https://Discord.com](https://discord.gg/rgPPDMWC)), or from a client on your computer, or even from their mobile app. Create an account with them, verify your email and phone number (don't worry, that stays with Discord), and then head over to our Discord channel and say hi!

{% hint style="info" %}
**Discord Link to Play:** [<mark style="color:purple;">**https://discord.gg/vPAgf7Q772**</mark>](https://discord.gg/vPAgf7Q772)<mark style="color:purple;">****</mark>
{% endhint %}

Now that you're in the NFTArcade Discord, you can join the game super easy. First you want to make sure you're in the <mark style="color:purple;">**#general-play-here**</mark> channel and then type the <mark style="color:purple;">/join</mark> command followed by your wallet address you want to associate with your Player account:

#### Example:

```
/join 0x327c2972d42eE0347A8338061b1FcF889431aFDc
```

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT!**</mark> _You can <mark style="color:orange;">**NOT**</mark> change your wallet address_ once you join, so make sure it's 100% correct!
{% endhint %}

Once that is completed, you will be given <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Rupeez-small (8) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">50 Rupeez as a bonus to start with and you can begin your journey. Now it's time to <mark style="color:purple;">/fight</mark> and <mark style="color:purple;">/explore</mark> !

### Earn Rupeez, Fight Villains, Gain Status!

From here you play the game as outlined in this whitepaper. You should skip to [Earning Rupeez](earning-points/) to see how you can earn enough Rupeez so that you can [Fight](fighting.md) your first [Minion](../tokens/villains/minion.md) to attempt to win the [n00b](../tokens/heroes/n00b.md) role NFT and Minion NFT!

At any point in the game, you can issue the /help command to list all the commands, or type in "!help" for the quick start guide, which will show this:

> <mark style="color:purple;">**Mint of Destiny Quick Help Guide**</mark>
