# Earning Points

The entire gameplay foundations revolves around the point system. There are various ways for you to earn points, and you'll need them to be able to fight the Villains to win roles, increase your [Hero Rank](hero-rank.md), and all other in-game mechanics.

The following is a table that outlines all the _Methods_ that you can earn points while playing The Mint of Destiny game in our Discord. You will earn the _Amount_ for each _Method._ You will then have to wait the _Cooldown Period_ before being able to earn points from that _Method_ again.

| Method                                               | Amount     | Cooldown Period             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| [Discord Post](earning-points.md#discord-post)       | 1 Point    | 5 Minutes                   |
| [Exploring](earning-points.md#undefined)             | Various    | 1 Hour                      |
| [Ownership Points](earning-points.md#undefined)      | Various    | None                        |
| [Tweets](earning-points.md#tweets)                   | 20 Points  | 6 Hours                     |
| [Refer-a-Friend](earning-points.md#refer-a-friend)   | 10 Points  | Until all n00b roles minted |
| [Burn n00b Hero](earning-points.md#burn-a-token)     | 250 Points | None                        |
| [Burn Hardcore Hero](earning-points.md#burn-a-token) | 500 Points | None                        |

## Discord Post

You can earn 1 point for every post that you make in the NFTArcade discord every 5 minutes. You can make as many posts as you like, but you will only get credit 5 minutes after the last post. We want to encourage interaction, but we don't need a spam-train running through the Discord either üòÅ

## Exploring

While enjoying some relaxing time in the Etherverse with your fellow Destonians, you may choose to explore the Etherverse for some bonus points!&#x20;

### How to Explore

In the Discord, just enter the following command. Just remember that you can only Explore once every hour.

```
/explore
```

### What Can Be Found?

There are three things that can be found while exploring:

1. NOTHING! - 50% chance
2. Bonus Points - 30% chance (Win 1-10 Points)
3. Villains - 20% chance

Should you encounter a Villain during your rummaging around, you will only be presented a type up to the cost of the amount of points you have. So if you only have 350 points, you will not encounter a Mini-Boss that requires 500 points to fight. You will have the choice to [Fight or Run](fighting.md)!

For all battles with Villains encountered by exploring, you can only win points. An official [Fight](fighting.md) must be entered while the combat arena is open to be awarded the NFT set.



## Ownership Points

While our Heroes are [Exploring](earning-points.md#exploring), they may run into a [Villain](../tokens/villains/). And if they do, the [Discord Bot](broken-reference) will randomly select a Villain for them to fight. Should the Villain is randomly selected be one that you own the NFT for, and the Hero loses the battle, you will be awarded a portion of the points that the battling Hero lost!

| Villain Type | Ownership Points Awarded |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Minion       | 10                       |
| Mini-Boss    | 50                       |
| Boss         | 100                      |

## Tweets

To earn points from a tweet, you must include the hashtag #MintOfDestiny and tag @NFTArca\_de in a tweet, then copy the link into discord to run the "/tweet \[link]" command in the chat.

Example: /tweet [https://twitter.com/kryptosucks/status/1523744500048609280](https://twitter.com/kryptosucks/status/1523744500048609280)

Our bots will automatically verify the tweet, then credit your account with the earned points. Our bots keep track of all the posts so that no one else can claim your post after you claim it.

To prevent spamming, we are limiting the amount of tweets you can post to earn points to 1 every 6 hours. You can post as many as you like on Twitter obviously, but you can only run the "/tweet \[link]" command six (6) hours after your last registered tweet for points.

## Refer-a-Friend

For every friend that you refer to the Discord channel to play the game, you will earn 10 points. We will only be awarding points via this method until all of the initial n00b role NFTs have been minted. Once they're gone, we will no longer be awarding points for referrals.

Here are the steps on how to refer a friend to the NFTArcade Discord:

1. Do something
2. then something else

## Burn a Token

You have the ability to [burn](../discord-bot/burn.md) a Hero token to gain massive points if you're going for a speed run, or having to recoup to make another attempt for the higher tokens. Depending on which token you burn, you will get varying points.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT**</mark>: You cannot undo a burning of a token. Once it is burned, it is forever gone and the total amount of tokens with that role has then been decreased by 1. This is a deflationary mechanic in the game that must be done wisely.
{% endhint %}
