# Earning Points

The entire gameplay foundations revolves around the point system. There are various ways for you to earn points, and you'll need them to be able to fight the Villains to win roles, increase your [Hero Rank](hero-rank.md), and all other in-game mechanics.

The following is a table that outlines all the _Methods_ that you can earn points while playing The Mint of Destiny game in our Discord. You will earn the _Amount_ for each _Method._ You will then have to wait the _Cooldown Period_ before being able to earn points from that _Method_ again.

| Method                       | Amount     | Cooldown Period             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Discord Post                 | 1 Point    | 5 Minutes                   |
| Tweet                        | 20 Points  | 6 Hours                     |
| Refer a Friend               | 10 Points  | Until all n00b roles minted |
| Burn n00b Hero               | 250 Points | None                        |
| Burn Hardcore Hero           | 500 Points | None                        |
| Ownership Points (Minion)    | 10 Points  | None                        |
| Ownership Points (Mini-Boss) | 50 Points  | None                        |
| Ownership Points (Boss)      | 100 Points | None                        |

### Discord Post

You can earn 1 point for every post that you make in the NFTArcade discord every 5 minutes. You can make as many posts as you like, but you will only get credit 5 minutes after the last post. We want to encourage interaction, but we don't need a spam-train running through the Discord either üòÅ

### Tweets

To earn points from a tweet, you must include the hashtag #MintOfDestiny and tag @NFTArca\_de in a tweet, then copy the link into discord to run the "/tweet \[link]" command in the chat.

Example: /tweet [https://twitter.com/kryptosucks/status/1523744500048609280](https://twitter.com/kryptosucks/status/1523744500048609280)

Our bots will automatically verify the tweet, then credit your account with the earned points. Our bots keep track of all the posts so that no one else can claim your post after you claim it.

To prevent spamming, we are limiting the amount of tweets you can post to earn points to 1 every 6 hours. You can post as many as you like on Twitter obviously, but you can only run the "/tweet \[link]" command six (6) hours after your last registered tweet for points.

### Refer a Friend

For every friend that you refer to the Discord channel to play the game, you will earn 10 points. We will only be awarding points via this method until all of the initial n00b role NFTs have been minted. Once they're gone, we will no longer be awarding points for referrals.

Here are the steps on how to refer a friend to the NFTArcade Discord:

1. Do something
2. then something else

### Burn a Token

You have the ability to [burn](../discord-bot/burn.md) a Hero token to gain massive points if you're going for a speed run, or having to recoup to make another attempt for the higher tokens. Depending on which token you burn, you will get varying points.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT**</mark>: You cannot undo a burning of a token. Once it is burned, it is forever gone and the total amount of tokens with that role has then been decreased by 1. This is a deflationary mechanic in the game that must be done wisely.
{% endhint %}

### Ownership Points
