# THE MINT OF DESTINY

### What is the Mint of Destiny?

The Mint of Destiny contains so much majesty that trying to put its limitless power into words is heresy. It is only the most important NFT to have ever existed in the Etherverse! The one NFT that outshines every other token in existence and that ever will come to being! It is the **1-of-1-of-1**. You read that right! The Mint of Destiny is so unbelievably rare, that it possesses a multi-dimensional rarity that no other NFT has ever achieved!

### Why Do I Want The Mint of Destiny?

Are you kidding me?! Why would someone want to own a Picasso? He made over 50,000 pieces of work. Why would someone want the power of world domination? Boooring.... Why would someone think a Bugatti Veyron is awesome? Anyone with a ton of money could get one. All of these are quarter-machine toys compared to the Mint of Destiny! There is only 1! That's it. FOREVER!

Oh and you get you push THE BIG GREEN BUTTON! ðŸ˜±

Yep, you heard that right. There is a [Big Green Button](the-vault.md) on the website ([https://MintOfDestiny.xyz](https://mintofdestiny.xyz)) that only the owner of the Mint Of Destiny can push. What does it do?! Oh man, the tension, must be KILLING YOU by this point! Ok... I'll tell you. The owner of The Mint of Destiny unlocks THE VAULT! WHHHHAATTTTT??!!!! Yes! When the owner pushes the Big Green Button on the site, the Minting Godz will have deemed them worthy and all of the treasures in the [Vault](the-vault.md) will be bestowed upon them!
