# ðŸ’Ž Earning Rupeez

The entire gameplay foundations revolves around the Rupee system. There are various ways for you to earn Rupeez, and you'll need them to be able to fight the Villains to win roles, increase your [Hero Rank](../hero-rank.md), and all other in-game mechanics.

The following is a table that outlines all the _Methods_ that you can earn Rupeez while playing The Mint of Destiny game in our Discord. You will earn the _Amount_ for each _Method._ You will then have to wait the _Cool-down Period_ before being able to earn Rupeez from that _Method_ again.
