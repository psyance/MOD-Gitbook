# ðŸŒŸ Ownership Rupeez

While our Heroes are [Exploring](ownership-points.md#exploring) or Fighting, they may run into a [Villain](../../tokens/villains/) that is owned by another player. If they do, the [Discord Bot](broken-reference) will randomly select a Villain for them to fight. Should the Villain that is randomly selected be one that you own the NFT for, and the Hero loses the battle, you will be awarded a portion of the Rupeez that the battling Hero lost!
