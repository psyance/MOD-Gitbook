# ðŸŒŸ Ownership Rupeez

While our Heroes are [Exploring](ownership-points.md#exploring), they may run into a [Villain](../../tokens/villains/). And if they do, the [Discord Bot](broken-reference) will randomly select a Villain for them to fight. Should the Villain that is randomly selected be one that you own the NFT for, and the Hero loses the battle, you will be awarded a portion of the Rupeez that the battling Hero lost!

| Villain Type | Ownership Rupeez Awarded |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Minion       | 10                       |
| Mini-Boss    | 50                       |
| Boss         | 100                      |
