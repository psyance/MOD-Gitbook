# ðŸ”¥ Burn a Token

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT**</mark>: You cannot undo a burning of a token. Once it is burned, it is forever gone and the total amount of tokens with that role has then been decreased by 1. This is a deflationary mechanic in the game that must be done wisely.
{% endhint %}

You have the ability to [burn](../../discord-bot/burn.md) a Hero token to gain massive points if you're going for a speed run, or having to recoup to make another attempt for the higher tokens. Depending on which token you burn, you will get varying points.

| Hero Token Burned | Points Earned |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| n00b              | 250           |
| Hardcore          | 500           |

{% hint style="info" %}
Hero Skins can not be burned by the game. Only Hero Default tokens.
