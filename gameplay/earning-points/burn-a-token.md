# ðŸ”¥ Burn a Token

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT**</mark>: You cannot undo a burning of a token. Once it is burned, it is forever gone and the total amount of tokens with that role has then been decreased by 1. This is a deflationary mechanic in the game that must be done wisely.
{% endhint %}

You have the ability to [burn](../../discord-bot/burn.md) a Hero token to gain massive quantities of Rupeez if you're going for a speed run, or having to recoup to make another attempt for the higher tokens. Depending on which token you burn, you will get a varying amount Rupeez.

| Hero Token Burned | Rupeez Earned                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| n00b              | <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Rupeez-small (5).png" alt="" data-size="line"> 250  |
| Hardcore          | <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Rupeez-small (11).png" alt="" data-size="line"> 500 |

{% hint style="info" %}
Hero Skins can not be burned by the game. Only Hero n00b and Hardcore tokens.
{% endhint %}

### Example

When you enter the burn command, you will first be presented with a confirmation prompt to make sure that you want to do this, as you can never get it back.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png>)

During the burning process, you will see this message:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>)

Once it has been burned, you'll be notified with the amount of Rupeez and XP you have gained:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png>)
