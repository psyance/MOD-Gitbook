# ðŸ”Ž Exploring

While enjoying some relaxing time in the Etherverse with your fellow Destonians, you may choose to explore the Etherverse for some bonus Rupeez!&#x20;

### How to Explore

In the Discord, just enter the following command. Just remember that you can only Explore once every hour.

```
/explore
```

### What Can Be Found?

Here is a list of everything that can be found while exploring:

1. NOTHING! - 40% chance
2. Bonus Rupeez - 30% chance (Win 1-5 Rupeez)
3. Villains - 10% chance
4. Trap - 20% chance (Loose 2-7 Rupeez)

Should you encounter a Villain during your rummaging around, you will only be presented a type up to the cost of the amount of Rupeez you have. So if you only have <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Rupeez-small (9) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">350 Rupeez, you will not encounter a Mini-Boss that requires <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Rupeez-small (9) (1) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">500 Rupeez to fight. You will have the choice to [Fight or Run](../fighting.md)!

For all battles with Villains encountered by exploring, you can only win Rupeez. An official [Fight](../fighting.md) must be entered while the combat arena is open to be awarded the NFT set.
