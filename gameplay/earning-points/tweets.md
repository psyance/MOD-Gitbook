# üê¶ Tweets

To earn Rupeez from a tweet, you must first be following [@NFTArca\_de](https://twitter.com/nftarca\_de) and include the hashtag #MintOfDestiny and tag @NFTArca\_de in a tweet, then copy the link into discord to run the "/tweet \[link]" command in the chat.

```
/tweet https://twitter.com/kryptosucks/status/1523744500048609280
```

Our bots will automatically verify the tweet, then credit your account with the earned Rupeez. Our bots keep track of all the posts so that no one else can claim your post after you claim it.

To prevent spamming, we are limiting the amount of tweets you can post to 1 tweet every 6 hours. You can post as many as you like on Twitter obviously, but you can only run the "/tweet \[link]" command six (6) hours after your last registered tweet for Rupeez. The timer is tracking tweets based on ID and Twitter name.
