### How to Duel

All duels take place within Discord. You will need to issue the following command:

```
/duel
```

If nobody is waiting for a duel, then you will be set as the next player in line to duel and will automatically battle the next user who uses the `/duel` command.

If you run the `/duel` command and another player is waiting in the queue, you will automatically duel them.

One of your villains is picked at random to fight the opponents randomly selected villain.

The formula for calculating the odds of you winning the duel is `Your villain lvl / (Your villain lvl + opponents villain lvl)`&#x20;
