{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">**Underdog Bonus!**</mark> If a lower level Villain defeats a higher level Villain, they will win an extra 10 XP!
{% endhint %}

If you are the winner, you can continue to duel others immediately, but if you lose, there is a 30 minute cool down window

### How to Duel

All duels take place within Discord. You will need to issue the following command:

```
/duel
```

If nobody is waiting for a duel, then you will be set as the next player in line to duel and will automatically battle the next user who uses the `/duel` command.

If you run the `/duel` command and another player is waiting in the queue, you will automatically duel them.

One of your villains is picked at random to fight the opponents randomly selected villain.

The formula for calculating the odds of you winning the duel is `Your villain lvl / (Your villain lvl + opponents villain lvl)`&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">ex. a level 3 villain has a 3/10 chance of beating a level 7 villain (3 / 3 + 7).</mark>
{% endhint %}

1. <mark style="color:purple;">**Fight**</mark> - This will enter your Hero into battle with the Villain. Should you win, you will receive the NFT of the Villain you just defeated, and the Hero NFT of the new role you just acquired.
2. <mark style="color:purple;">**Run**</mark> - Change your mind and don't want to fight? You can run away and only loose half the Rupeez of a loss.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Discord Bot will always challenge you with a Villain of the lowest type that you do not own. So if you have a Hardcore Role, but not the n00b role, you will be challenged with a Minion to fight. So make sure to keep at least 1 of each role in your wallet!
{% endhint %}

Sometimes, the Villains can be a bit crafty and run away should you challenge them to a fight! They get away with it by dropping a pouch of Rupeez on the ground to distract you. So not all is lost!

### Villain Rank

The rank of a Villain is directly tied to the chance of winning the fight when you attempt it. The level is 1/10th the chance you have to lose. So if a Villain is a Level 4, you will have a 40% chance of losing the fight against them. There is nothing you can do to improve or worsen the odds. Everyone that fights that Villain will have the same 60% chance of winning.
