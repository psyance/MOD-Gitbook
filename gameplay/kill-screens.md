# Kill Screens

Kill Screens are the infamous "_Holy crap, you've gone farther in the game than was ever intended, so now it just breaks the code and dies_" screens from some of the most popular games that created the video game industry as we know it.

We wanted to pay an homage to them and offer up the ability for the most god-like players that want to prove their reign over everyone else in the game.

### How Many Kill Screens Are There?

There are only 20 [Kill Screen Tokens](../tokens/kill-screens.md) that can be won.&#x20;

### How To Try For a Kill Screen?

You will need a few things first before you even _think_ about attempting a Kill Screen!&#x20;

* [n00b](../tokens/heroes/n00b.md) NFT
* [Hardcore](../tokens/heroes/hardcore.md) NFT
* [Legendary](../tokens/heroes/legendary.md) NFT
* [4,200 Points](earning-points.md)

Once you have all of those you can run the following command in Discord to launch the next step in the Kill Screen prep command to verify your supreme gaming abilities (that you meet the requirements to try):

```
/killscreen prep
```

You will be presented with the confirmation that you want to proceed with a Kill Screen attempt, and that by doing so, you will immediately lose 2,100 points for the attempt. Should you win the Kill Screen, you will receive all of your points back plus the Kill Screen NFT!

Once you confirm, the bot will then register your account on the blockchain to be open for an attempt on the Kill Screen and 2,100 points will be taken from your account.

Next you will need to launch the Kill Screen attack:

```
/killscreen stake
```

When you launch the Kill Screen stake command, a browser will be opened and take you to the Mint of Destiny website where you will have to stake all three of your NFTs (n00b, Hardcore, and Legendary). Once all of your NFTs have been staked, you can return to the Discord to issue the final command, the Kill Screen Attack!

```
/killscreen attack
```

You've laid it all out on the line, and now comes the moment of truth! Depending on which Kill Screen number you are attempting will determine the difficulty of the attack.&#x20;
