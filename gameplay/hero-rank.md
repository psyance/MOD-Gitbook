# Hero Rank

Everyone wants to know who the best player is in any games, so we have made a simple way to show the top players in order by rank. A players ranks is purely determined by the amount of points that they have earned cumulatively throughout the duration of the game.

As you [earn points](earning-points.md), your rank score will increase. As you use your points to fight or attempts other in-game mechanics, these point losses will not be removed from your total rank score. Your rank score can only go up!
