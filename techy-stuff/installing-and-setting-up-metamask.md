# Installing and Setting up Metamask

### Step 1 - Install Metamask

Download the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet browser extension or mobile app.

If you're new, click **Create a Wallet**. If you already have a compatible wallet, you can also select **Import Wallet**.

Your wallet information is extremely important and very sensitive. If you lose your seed phrase, no one can recover it for you which means that your account, along with your tokens and items, will be lost forever. Please take the time to create a strong password and to securely store your recovery information.

### Step 2 - Add Polygon to Metamask

In Metamask, click on the current network which is Ethereum Mainnet by default. At the bottom of the list of networks, click **Add Network**.
