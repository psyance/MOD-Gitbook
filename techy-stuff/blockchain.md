The Mint of Destiny uses the Polygon (MATIC) network. Polygon is a protocol and framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. It resolves the issues of slow speed and high transaction fees, whilst keeping the security and usability of Ethereum. For players, the gaming experience will be the same, but with expensive 'gas' fees no longer an issue.

Many other large scale NFT gaming projects also use the Polygon network for the same reasons, including Wizards and Dragins, Etherorcs, ZED RUN, Decentraland, Aavegotchi, and Ethermon.
